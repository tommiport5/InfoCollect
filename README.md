##InfoCollect
InfoCollect provides an environment for collecting and visualizing climate and resource consumption data of your home. It is based on the project 
[AI-on the edge-device](https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device) by @jomjol which also appeared in Make magazine 4 / 2021.
Originally conceived as a device to read out a watermeter, it has been adapted to many read out purposes by a growing comunity. My adaption is for a standard German gas meter,
and the softwate serves this out of the box. I only had to provide a mechanical stand and a cardboard "housing" to eliminate ambient light and reduce reflections.
